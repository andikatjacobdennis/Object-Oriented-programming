# Object-Oriented-programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions in a structured and reusable way. 

## Core OOP Concepts Explained (with Example)

| Concept           | Definition (Microsoft)                               | Animal Example                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Abstraction**   | Model real-world entities as classes                 | Animal is an abstract base class   |
| **Encapsulation** | Hide internal state, use public members              | _name is private, `Name` is public |
| **Inheritance**   | Create new classes from existing ones                | Dog : Animal, Cat : Animal       |
| **Polymorphism**  | Same method behaves differently in different classes | Speak() outputs "Woof!" or "Meow!" |
