# Object-Oriented-programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions in a structured and reusable way.
