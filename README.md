# Object-Oriented Programming in C#

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects combine data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions in a structured and reusable way. 

## Core OOP Concepts

| Concept           | Microsoft Definition                                 | Animal Example (in C#)                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Abstraction**   | Model real-world entities as classes                 | `abstract class Animal`                    |
| **Encapsulation** | Hide internal state, use public members              | `private string _name; public string Name` |
| **Inheritance**   | Create new classes from existing ones                | `class Dog : Animal`, `class Cat : Animal` |
| **Polymorphism**  | Same method behaves differently in different classes | `Speak()` overridden in `Dog` and `Cat`    |
